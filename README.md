# Test github environment
This is a first experiment in github to see how versioning in github works. The interesting thing is that you can write using markup in this small window without any problem. 
This line is added in the first branch of the project just to test how that looks as soon as I want to merge this to the original text. 

Let's see how we can create some sections:

## This is the first section header
Here is the first section, starting with a section 2 level header indicated by "##". 

## Added an extra section
This is an extra edit started in the "readme-edits" branch as suggested by the hello world tutorial over at github. It is a nice extra paragraph at the end of the original text, but I will also add some text in between existing text.
